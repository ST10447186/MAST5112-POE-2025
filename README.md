Changelog:
This log details the major changes and updates made to the PrivateChef Menu Management App.

v1.0.1 - Bugfixes and Final Cleanup
FIXED: Resolved critical module resolution errors (U and red squiggle indicators) across the entire project by correcting all relative import paths in App.tsx, index.ts, and all files inside the screens/ directory (e.g., changing ./interfaces to ../interfaces).

FIXED: Corrected a critical syntax error in MenuItemCard.tsx where the functional component props destructuring used incorrect double parentheses ((( ... ))).

FIXED: Corrected a typo in App.tsx importing the screen as GustViewScreen instead of GuestViewScreen.

FIXED: Ensured all necessary components (Text, TouchableOpacity) are correctly imported from react-native where they are used (e.g., in the renderScreen block of App.tsx).

v1.0.0 - Initial Release & Core Functionality
NEW: Implemented the core modular architecture with separate interfaces.ts and a dedicated screens/ folder.

NEW: Created the Chef's View (Home Screen).

Displays menu list with prices, edit, and delete buttons.

Includes a summary of total items and average price.

NEW: Developed the Add/Edit Menu Item Screen.

Form handles Dish Name, Description, Price, and Course selection (Starters/Mains/Desserts).

NEW: Created the Guest View with Filter Screen.

Menu is filterable by course.

Prices are hidden for customer view.

NEW: Established simple, state-based navigation logic within App.tsx to switch between ChefHome, MenuForm, and GuestView.
